# Fixing XHR Complications with Fetch

## Learning Goals

- Update and Refactor Asynchronous Code
- Practice utilizing fetch in place of XMLHttpRequests

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we briefly explored how XMLHttpRequests can require to
do a bit of code nesting. When building web apps and pages, this sort of thing
can happen a lot. Imagine you wanted to build an app that checked the weather,
then, depending on the received data, checked for weather appropriate local
events. One request for data is dependent on the other, requiring us to wait
for the resolution of the first request before sending the next.

With XMLHttpRequests, programmers are required to set up the code for opening,
setting up, then sending requests, resulting in a lot of repetitive code.
